This is my first blog on web development.

And it is REALLY the first time that I have EVER tried jekyll.

To be honest, the documentation of jekyll is just like SHIT. At first, I supposed it my weakness in English which made me confused for a long time. However, after I switched the doc page into a Chinese one, I can hardly understand how to go through EITHER!!!  

Now I am still working on how to make it...

Hope you guys follow me on [github](https://github.com/ANDI-Mckee "ANDI-Mckee's Github").
